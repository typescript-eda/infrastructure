* Overview

This repository contains the infrastructure adapters and implementations for the TypeScript-EDA event-driven architecture framework. It provides concrete implementations of ports defined in the domain layer, following hexagonal architecture principles.

* Repository History

** Monorepo Separation (2024-01-07)

This repository was extracted from the original chatgpt-buddy monorepo as part of Phase 8A of the Semantest platform evolution. The separation preserves the complete git history of the typescript-eda-infrastructure directory.

*** Key Changes
- Extracted from =typescript-eda-infrastructure/= directory in the monorepo
- Now published as =@typescript-eda/infrastructure= on npm
- Repository URL: https://github.com/typescript-eda/infrastructure
- Part of the typescript-eda organization
- Depends on =@typescript-eda/domain=

*** Post-Separation Setup Required
1. Update package.json dependencies from workspace references to npm packages
2. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
3. Configure npm publishing with NPM_TOKEN secret
4. Update README with proper documentation

** Package Configuration Updates (2025-01-07)

As part of the post-monorepo-separation tasks, the package.json was updated to reflect the new organizational structure:

*** Changes Made
- Updated package name to =@typescript-eda/infrastructure= (using the typescript-eda npm organization)
- Updated repository URLs to point to =https://github.com/typescript-eda/infrastructure=
- Updated bugs URL to =https://github.com/typescript-eda/infrastructure/issues=
- Updated homepage to =https://github.com/typescript-eda/infrastructure=
- Changed dependency from workspace reference to npm package: =@typescript-eda/domain@^1.0.0=
- Added =@typescript-eda/domain= as both a dependency and peerDependency
- Added =publishConfig= with public access for npm publishing
- Added proper author attribution to "TypeScript-EDA Team"

*** Rationale
These changes complete the transition from the monorepo structure to independent repositories under the typescript-eda GitHub organization. The package now properly declares its dependency on the domain package via npm, ensuring clean separation of concerns while maintaining the architectural relationship between domain and infrastructure layers.

** Original Development

The infrastructure package was developed to provide production-ready adapters for:
- Event bus implementations (RabbitMQ, Kafka, In-Memory)
- Repository implementations (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, In-Memory)
- Command and query buses
- External service adapters

* Technical Architecture

** Adapter Categories

*** Event Bus Adapters
- RabbitMQ adapter with reliable messaging
- Kafka adapter for high-throughput scenarios
- In-memory adapter for testing
- Event serialization/deserialization

*** Repository Adapters
- PostgreSQL with event sourcing support
- MongoDB for document-based aggregates
- In-memory for testing
- Transaction management

*** External Service Adapters
- HTTP client adapters
- WebSocket adapters
- Authentication adapters
- Monitoring and logging adapters

** Design Patterns
- Hexagonal architecture (ports and adapters)
- Dependency injection
- Interface segregation
- Open/closed principle

* Future Roadmap

- Add Redis event bus adapter
- Implement CQRS read model projections
- Add GraphQL adapter
- Improve error handling and retry logic
- Add comprehensive integration tests
