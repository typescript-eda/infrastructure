* Overview

This repository contains the infrastructure adapters and implementations for the TypeScript-EDA event-driven architecture framework. It provides concrete implementations of ports defined in the domain layer, following hexagonal architecture principles.

* Repository History

** Monorepo Separation (2024-01-07)

This repository was extracted from the original chatgpt-buddy monorepo as part of Phase 8A of the Semantest platform evolution. The separation preserves the complete git history of the typescript-eda-infrastructure directory.

*** Key Changes
- Extracted from =typescript-eda-infrastructure/= directory in the monorepo
- Now published as =@typescript-eda/infrastructure= on npm
- Repository URL: https://github.com/typescript-eda/infrastructure
- Part of the typescript-eda organization
- Depends on =@typescript-eda/domain=

*** Post-Separation Setup Required
1. Update package.json dependencies from workspace references to npm packages
2. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
3. Configure npm publishing with NPM_TOKEN secret
4. Update README with proper documentation

** Original Development

The infrastructure package was developed to provide production-ready adapters for:
- Event bus implementations (RabbitMQ, Kafka, In-Memory)
- Repository implementations (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, In-Memory)
- Command and query buses
- External service adapters

* Technical Architecture

** Adapter Categories

*** Event Bus Adapters
- RabbitMQ adapter with reliable messaging
- Kafka adapter for high-throughput scenarios
- In-memory adapter for testing
- Event serialization/deserialization

*** Repository Adapters
- PostgreSQL with event sourcing support
- MongoDB for document-based aggregates
- In-memory for testing
- Transaction management

*** External Service Adapters
- HTTP client adapters
- WebSocket adapters
- Authentication adapters
- Monitoring and logging adapters

** Design Patterns
- Hexagonal architecture (ports and adapters)
- Dependency injection
- Interface segregation
- Open/closed principle

* Future Roadmap

- Add Redis event bus adapter
- Implement CQRS read model projections
- Add GraphQL adapter
- Improve error handling and retry logic
- Add comprehensive integration tests
